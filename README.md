# *Colmar Academy* homepage Demo Project 🌐
This repository contains my demonstration of the Colmar Academy homepage, completed as a part of a front-end development course on Codecademy. It is a small assignment that helped me practice and apply fundamental HTML and CSS concepts learned during the course. 
The project involved creating a static webpage for an imaginary academy, utilizing basic web development skills.
